This project is not maintained and was merely a neat experiment for improving the workflow I had with GameSparks during the time I worked on a contract that required their backend services. For a much better solution I'd recommend looking into the services and APIs provided by https://heroiclabs.com/. They have a great open-source backend alternative (Nakama) with several easy-to-use helper libraries for engines such as Unity.

# Unity-Spark-Tools
Framework that wraps GameSparks' RealTime Services making it similar to Photon/UNET.
